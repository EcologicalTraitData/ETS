# Abstract 

The Ecological Traitdata Standard (ETS) is a collection of terms for datasets on quantitative and qualitative organism properties (i.e. traits) that describe its performance or function in an ecosystem. It also includes recommendations on how to structure such data for upload in public databases. 
The ETS provides a low-threshold standard, suitable for storing own trait data locally, or for publishing them on a scientific database or filehosting service.
