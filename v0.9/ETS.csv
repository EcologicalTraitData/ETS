Integer values apply to count data (e.g. eggs per clutch). Binary data (encoded as 0 or 1) or logical data (coded as TRUE or FALSE) may apply to qualitative traits such as specific behavior during mating (e.g. are territories defended) or specialization to a given habitat (e.g. species restricted to relicts of primeval forests). Categorical traits should define a constrained set of factor levels, such as sex differences in wing morphology (both sexes winged, both sexes unwinged, only males winged, only females winged) or unconstrained entries such as color. Ordinal categorical traits may be better encoded as integer values, e.g. a logical sequence as in the case of life stages or hibernation stages, or habitat preference traits such as horizontal stratum use."
