title: "Version history"

Terminologies must provide a stability of definitions. If publications refer to the URI of a term, the definition found must be stable and be true to the definition intended by the author.

That said, definitions of terms can only be broadened or made more explicit, if the original sense of the definition remains valid. The discussion leading to a refinement of a term should consider this. If a definition changes substantially, it should receive an own URI and replace any redundant or deprecated terms. The deprecated terms will remain available at the same URI.

At some point, a new major version of the Traitdata Standard may be issued, providing new versioned URIs for all terms of the standard that have been altered since the previous major version.
