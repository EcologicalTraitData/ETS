Traitlist,Identifier,,http://ecologicaltraitdata.github.io/ETS/#Identifier,,,,,v0.4,24/10/2017,,unique identifier for the trait,Identifiers are ideally unique and stable URI which identify the source of the trait
Traitlist,trait,,http://ecologicaltraitdata.github.io/ETS/#trait,,,,,v0.4,24/10/2017,,human-readable trait name,"Trait names should be unique but understandable by humans. Additional specifications such as unit of measurement can be included in the name. Several words are separated by ""_""."
Traitlist,broaderTerm,,http://ecologicaltraitdata.github.io/ETS/#broaderTerm,,,,,v0.4,24/08/2017,10/24/2017,indicates the hierarchical level of the trait,The broader term is given as the unique identifier (traitID) of the broader trait. Each trait can only have one broader term.
Traitlist,narrowerTerm,,http://ecologicaltraitdata.github.io/ETS/#narrowerTerm,,,,,v0.4,24/08/2017,10/24/2017,indicates the hierarchical level of the trait,Optional. Several traits can be listed as narrower terms of one trait.
Traitlist,valueType,,http://ecologicaltraitdata.github.io/ETS/#valueType,,,,,v0.4,27/09/2017,,"type of trait values. Defines the trait as numeric, integer, categorical, binary/logical, or character. ","Numerical values represent measurements of length, volumes, ratios, rates or timespans. Integer values apply to count data (e.g. eggs per clutch). Binary data (encoded as 0 or 1) or logical data (coded as TRUE or FALSE) may apply to qualitative traits such as specific behaviour during mating (e.g. are territories defended) or specialisation to a given habitat (e.g. species restricted to relicts of primeval forests). Categorical traits should define a constrained set of factor levels, such as sex differences in wing morphology (both sexes winged, both sexes unwinged, only males winged, only females winged) or unconstrained entries such as color. Ordinal categorical traits may be better encoded as integer values, e.g. a logical sequence as in the case of life stages or hibernation stages, or habitat preference traits such as horizontal stratum use."
Traitlist,expectedUnit,,http://ecologicaltraitdata.github.io/ETS/#expectedUnit,,,,,y0.4,24/10/2017,,the unit of measurement,Only applies to numerical traits. Should be given in SI units.

Traitlist,traitDescription,,http://ecologicaltraitdata.github.io/ETS/#traitDescription,,,,,v0.4,27/09/2017,,"short, unambiguous definition of the trait.

Traitlist,Comments,,http://ecologicaltraitdata.github.io/ETS/#Comments,,,,,v0.3,07/07/2017,10/24/2017,further description of the trait,Can contain definition of trait levels or requirements for standardized conditions.
Traitlist,relationSource,,http://ecologicaltraitdata.github.io/ETS/#relationSource,,,,,v0.4,24/10/2017,,the relation to the original source.,equals: trait is taken directly from the sources without modification / takenfrom: the trait is based on a trait list which does not include formal descriptions or trait-specific references (e.g. the trait was used in a scientific publication or is provided in taxonomic literature) / refines: the trait gives a more precice definition of the original trait / broadens: the trait gives a more general definition of the original trait / inheritsfrom: the trait is slight modification of the original trait but changes in the definition of the original trait should be reflected in this trait as well (e.g. Body_length_max is a modification of Body_length).
Traitlist,source,,http://ecologicaltraitdata.github.io/ETS/#source,,,,,v0.4,24/10/2017,,the original source of the trait,Can be the URI of a trait in the same or a different database or a stable link to a publication.
